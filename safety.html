                   <p>     Lori’s Creations holds 5 million Public Liability Insurance and a fully enhanced disclosure. These documents can be presented at any time for our client’s reassurance.</p>

                    <p>
                        Lori’s Creations only uses professional quality water-based face paints and cosmetic glitters and glue that are FDA and EU approved.

                    </p>  <p>
                        Our products are specifically designed for face and body and the brands that we use are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tag</li>
                            <li>Diamond FX</li>
                            <li>Grimas</li>
                            <li>Wolfe Bros</li>
                            <li>Superstar</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>  <p>
                        Please note that Lori’s Creations will not be liable for any adverse

                        reaction to paints, glitters, glues or SFX products.

                    </p><p>
                        Good hygiene is imperative so we use a clean sponge per face and our brushes are

                        rinsed thoroughly in clean water which is changed frequently between faces.

                    </p> <p>
                        When Hiring Lori’s Creations please read and understand are policies to make sure your day is the happiest it can be.

                    </p><p>
                        Please present your child with a clean face.
                    </p><p>
                        We will not paint any one with a skin infection of any kind or sensitive skin
                    </p><p>
                        At public events young children in our queue should be accompanied.
                        For private parties, we will assume that parental consent has been obtained for all the children unless stated otherwise by the host of the party.
                        It is of utmost importance that every child is happy and comfortable to be painted so for this reason we will not paint any child against their wishes.
                        Please do not force your child to be painted if they are unsure or if they decide at any point that they no longer wish to be painted the face painter will stop. The experience should be fun for the child.
                    </p>
                        <p>
                        We will not paint under 2s </p>

                        Removing Paint/Temp tattoos

                        Removal of paint can be done using water, mild soap and a clean flannel. Baby shampoo is also excellent for removing paints from the face. It is not advised that baby wipes or cleansing lotions are used as this may cause the skin to become irritated. Glitter tattoos are easy to remove with baby oil or any other oil based product.

                        Some paints can leave a slight colour stain to the skin which will usually fade within a day or so, namely Red, Green and Blue.

                        We take every precaution not to get any paints on clothes but should a stain occur we recommend removing by soaking in cold water and using soap thereafter. We cannot be held liable for damaged clothes or property.
